Both Mac and Linux systems provide a built-in SSH client, eliminating the need to install any additional package. To connect to a SSH server, open the terminal and type the following command:

ssh[username]@[hostname]

For example, to connect to PARAM Rudra cluster:
For IUAC Users:

<!-- ssh `<span style="color:#259AA4;text-decoration:underline">`user1@paramrudra.iuac.res.in -->

```
user1@paramrudra.iuac.res.in
```

For External Users:

<!-- ssh `<span style="color:#259AA4;text-decoration:underline">`user1@paramrudra.iuac.res.in -p 4422 -->

```
user1@paramrudra.iuac.res.in -p 4422
```

After entering captcha, you will be prompted for a password. Once entered, you will be connected to the server.

After getting credentials you may access the cluster, please remember the following points:

- When you log in to the cluster, you will land on the login nodes. The login node serves as the primary gateway to the rest of the cluster, housing a job scheduler (known called Slurm) and other applications for creating and submitting the job. You can submit jobs to the queue, and they will execute when the required resources become available.
- Please refrain from running jobs directly on the login node. Login nodes are intended for compiling codes, transferring data and submitting jobs. If you run your job directly on the login node, it will be terminated.
- By default, two directories are available (i.e. /home and /scratch). These directories are available on the login node as well as the other nodes on the cluster. /scratch is for temporary data storage, generally used to store data required for running jobs. Users are requested to regularly back up their own data in scratch directory. As per policy, any files not accessed in the last three months will be permanently deleted.
