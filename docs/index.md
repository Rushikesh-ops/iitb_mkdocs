# Introduction

This document is the user manual for the PARAM Rudra Supercomputing facility at IUAC Delhi. It covers a wide range of topics ranging from a detailed description of the hardware infrastructure to the information required to utilize the supercomputer, such as information about logging on to the supercomputer, submitting jobs, retrieving the results on to the user's Laptop/ Desktop etc. In short, the manual describes all that one needs to know to effectively utilize PARAM Rudra.

The supercomputer PARAM Rudra is based on heterogeneous and hybrid configuration of Intel Xeon 2nd Gen Cascade Lake processors, and NVIDIA Ampere A100 GPU cards. The system was designed and implemented by HPC Technologies group, Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC).

It consists of 10 Login nodes, 2 visualization nodes, 8 Management and 599 (CPU+GPU+HM) compute nodes with total peak computing capacity of (CPU+GPU+HM) 3.1 PFLOPS.
