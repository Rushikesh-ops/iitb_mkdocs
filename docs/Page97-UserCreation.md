# User Creation Process

To get access to this HPC Facility, proceed with registration on the Portal through the link provided below:

Link:  [https://services.nsmindia.in/userportal/account](https://services.nsmindia.in/userportal/account) 

Once registered, you will receive an email outlining the next steps to be followed for your User Creation Request.

User Creation Portal streamlines the user data collection process, enabling multiple users to submit user creation requests simultaneously. Physical form maintenance is eliminated; users need to provide accurate official details and an email address for procedural notifications. Users can track their account creation status, remaining steps, and identify necessary actions. Administrative or Higher authorities can access all user details through secure login into the portal.

## Process/Steps

Users initiate registration on the portal by entering their email address, city, and institute name. An email will be sent to verify the provided email address, upon verification registration form link is sent for completing the user account request. Users have the option to preview and edit the form before the final submission. Upon submission, a link for Document Upload is provided, where documents like ID proof, User Creation Form and other needed documents are uploaded. Once documents are uploaded, modifications are not possible as the documents will undergo verification processes.

User details and documents undergo verification by the user's Institute HOD/PI. Upon approval, a verification email is sent to the coordinator. The coordinator selects the appropriate cluster for the user based on document verification and requirements. Final approval is granted by higher authority, resulting in acceptance of the user request.

If you have any queries, refer to the User Creation Manual and Flowcharts accessible in the Help section within the User Creation Portal. Furthermore, common questions are addressed in the FAQ section located beside the Help section. If you have any additional inquiries or require assistance, feel free to reach out to us at **nsmsupport@cdac.in**.
